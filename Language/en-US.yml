  STR_BATARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "4-eyed humanoids. Despite an extra pair of eyes, the rest of the body looks surprisingly human. Physically, they are about as strong as an average human soldier. 4-eyed captives are grumpy and uncooperative, prone to attack both X-COM personnel and 2-eyed inmates. Attempts to teach them any human language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_SALARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Upright-walking bug-eyed horned frogs. Physically weaker and frailer than humans or any other aliens, but excellent marksmen. Often throw various grenades, such as incendiary or EMP. Inquisitive and fast, they will try to steal weapons and escape at the first opportunity. The prisoners have quickly picked up several human words, but we still can't communicate beyond simplest commands and requests. Either their language is incomprehensibly difficult, or they are pulling our leg.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE_1: "Ugly sharp-toothed humanoids with spikes at the back of their heads and at elbows. They compensate poor aim with bursts and volleys. Their wounds heal very fast, but they aren't much more durable than humans. Uncooperative and aggressive, but easily intimidated with superior force. Attempts to teach them our language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_VARREN_ARTICLE_1: "Alien lizard used as a wardog. About as strong and clever as a dog, but with bigger fangs and much harder to kill."
  STR_QUARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Lean humanoids wearing hazmat suits with opaque vizors. Their automated turrets are very dangerous, but they surrender easily without them. However, they will fight with renewed vigor, when we try to open their suits. Attempts to teach them our language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}These aliens refuse to eat any food besides what they carried upon themselves. If we can't figure out their problem, we'd have to transfer them to a facility, where they can be force-fed. Of course, our scientists won't be able to study them there, and others' results won't arrive soon."
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE_1: "Blue-skinned humanoids extremelly similar to human women, if you forget rigid head tentacles. With wigs and body paint they can easily pass up as humans.{NEWLINE}Those witches are extremelly attractive to BOTH genders. And they know it! Prisoners have repeatedly tried to initiate some intimate hugging with guards and grab the guard's neck while at it. They had to be discouraged with non-lethal measures.{NEWLINE}All specimen manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Humanoids, if you stretch the definition to a creature covered with armor plates, with non-functional flat mandibles, bird-like hands and feet (with rooster spurs) and a beakless parrot head (featherless, but crested). They tend to be armed better than most aliens and demonstrate best combat skills. Physically they are a match to a human in peak physical condition.{NEWLINE}Prisoners have desperately tried to communicate something. When that failed due to language barrier, they started a hunger strike. If we can't figure why, we'd have to transfer them to a facility, where they can be force-fed. Of course, our scientists won't be able to study them there, and others' results won't arrive soon.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE_1: "Those humanoid dinosaurs are very strong and surprisingly fast. They quickly regenerate and can stand a lot of punishment. A single dino can carry an arsenal big enough to down an air wing and armour to match an APC. Communication attempts yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}A warning to guards: do not try to beat them! Dinos seem to mistake it for a sparring invitation — without an intent to kill, but still dangerously lethal due to their strength. Just shoot them — they'll get the point faster that way.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_DRELL_ARTICLE_1: "A lean green lizard-like alien (although some called him a frog for his color), who surrendered to us. He(?) knows English and has asked to speak with X-COM high command. We need to study him further to decide."
  # First glimpses of alien technology
  STR_AGUNS: "Alien Kinetic Weapons"
  STR_AGUNS_ARTICLE: "Despite their technological superiority aliens still employ kinetic weapons. Albeit their guns are collapsible, muzzle velocity is hypersonic and ammunition load is estimated above 50 000 shots. They seem to use electromagnetic acceleration, but we have no clue about the power source.{NEWLINE}No two guns are alike (replicator-manufactured on the spot?), but they all fall into 4 categories roughly equivalent to our pistols/SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles.{NEWLINE}They all possess intuitive point-and-click interface without any hint of ID locks. Our operatives should have no trouble using them."
  STR_OMNITOOL: "Alien PDA."
  STR_OMNITOOL_ARTICLE: "This deice is forearm-mounted. It is an alien PDA/communicator/replicator. We've successfuly employed it to build an EMP grenade that burned all computers in the room (insurance claim forms attached) and a silicon blade Dr.Mbayo stabbed himself with (by accident). We paused further investigation until we can read the alien language."
  STR_HYPERNET: "Hypernet"
  STR_HYPERNET_ARTICLE: "A global network we dubbed “Hypernet” encompasses the whole galaxy. We have no idea how hyperluminal communication works, but the end result is a lot like our Internet. Or Fidonet, considerind its heterogenity and lags.{NEWLINE}Search tools are surprisingly useless, far below Veronica or even Altavista. But we can use them as a starting point and ask around. We've already came up with about 20 topics to research. All it takes is an alien PDA and some time."
  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE: "Alien Languages"
  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE_ARTICLE: "Each alien species has multiple languages. Each PDA is capable of synchronous translating between any alien languages. With the help of our alien prisoners we've managed to cobble together adequate translation modules for several Earth languages.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}While translation from English works fine most of the time, we recommend double-checking it by translating the same phrase from Latin, Turkish or Esperanto."

  STR_TRAWLING_LAST_ARTICLE: "We've been banned for, quote, “unfunny trolling with feigned ignorance” at every public board we posted to. Enraged subscribers started a hunt against us, seeing our collective alias as a single person. They wrote multiple complaints to Hypernet providers. Under such pressure providers have blacklisted our exit node. Unless HU bothers changing its address, the rest of Hypernet will remain inaccessible from this segment. Only HU-owned nodes are currently accessible from Solar System, which suits their security service just fine.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Some people just can't stand innocent questions about their system of values."
  # STR_TRAWLING_00: "Trawling: 4-eyed aliens"
  STR_BATARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The 4-eyed aliens took longer than most to enter the galactic stage. They are despised by their neighbours for their archaic society organization, primarily for caste system and slavery. Their government frequently starts or announces ambitious projects, which they can never afford. Which doesn't improve their respectability. Which provokes more conflicts with 4-eyed.{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, they are our closest neighbours. If their colonization program budget wasn't embezzled several times in a row, they would have found Earth around 1500 CE.{NEWLINE}Their authoritarian government doesn't like its subjects leaving their systems. Those, who do, tend to be outlaws or heavily-armed merchants.{NEWLINE}The majority of 4-eyed in Solar system are employed by PMCs servicing HU: as fighters, or less frequently engineers."
  # STR_TRAWLING_01: "Trawling: Bug-eyed horned aliens"
  STR_SALARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The horned aliens are a race of short-living geniuses. The best of them acheive more in 40 years than many do in centuries. They hold a seat in a ruling galactic council, and their intelligence network gets its due fear and respect.{NEWLINE}The ones typically working for HU are losers who can't get a job in a more civilized place with a less disreputable employee. Typical occupations include: scientist, technician and mercenary engineer."
  # STR_TRAWLING_02: "Trawling: Spiky aliens"
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE_2: "The Spikies descend from savages “saved” from their homeworld and transplanted to other planets. While mentally on par with humans and most aliens, Spikies live only 20 years and hardly have time for proper education. Most don't bother. These days the majority are employed as canon fodder by cheaper mercenary outfits.{NEWLINE}Their unique biology — large, but non-replenishable(?) pool of stem cells — allows individuals to adapt to harsh environment by altering their organs. For all we know, some of them may survive on Mars for hours without suits."
  # STR_TRAWLING_03: "Trawling: Hazmat aliens"
  STR_QUARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The Hazmats are the youngest civilization, discovering interstellar flight in the 18th century. For a while they were developing faster than anybody else — mainly in the electronics field — but then disaster struck. A network of electronic machinery suddenly gained sentience and kicked its creators off their planets. The survivors and their descendands were forced to wander the galaxy in dilapidated ships.{NEWLINE}Their role in the galactic society somewhat resembles Gypsies of Medieval Europe. They have a reputation of great specialists in means of transport and expensive trinkets. They are distrusted strangers wherever they go. They are always suspected of theft.{NEWLINE}We hypothesize that lack of vitamins from their homeworld weakens their immune systems (not unlike AIDS). They have to remain suited at all times, even aboard their ships."
  # STR_TRAWLING_04: "Trawling: Blue aliens"
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE_2: "Blues are a monogendered race that can crossbreed with “anything with a brain”. There's a social stigma to those, who marry inside their own species, but the reasoning we found is contradictory. Everybody is telekinetic and has limited telepathic abilities. We speculate that their universal attractiveness also stems from telepathy, not necessaryly conscious.{NEWLINE}Young ones (100-200 years) outside home systems tend to work as mercenaries or strippers; more mature ones (200-1000 years) may be encountered in any role."
  # STR_TRAWLING_05: "Trawling: Bird-like aliens"
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE_2: "Birds are the law enforcers of the galactic government. They've got the largest fleet and they join police forces more often than anybody else.{NEWLINE}Despite stereotyping, their society isn't too militarized and peaceful professions are honoured too. Just don't forget that all adult citizens spend 15 years as conscripts, and any clerk has battlefield experience.{NEWLINE}'Barefaced' outcasts are a special case. They are few, but only compared to multi-billion population, and they make dangerous mercenaries and pirates."
  # STR_TRAWLING_06: "Trawling: Dinosaur aliens"
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE_2: "In the distant past Horned uplifted Dinos, from early atomic to interstellar technologies, to use them as soldiers. Several centuries later their uncontrolled breeding prompted a war for living space. Right now their majority — around 1 billion — are confined to their unhospitable homeworld, and the few that escaped it work as mercenaries."
  # STR_TRAWLING_07: "Trawling: Other aliens, if any"
  STR_OTHER_ALIENS: "Aliens Unlikely to Appear"
  STR_OTHER_ALIENS_ARTICLE: "The alien species that go to Solar system tend to come from top and bottom of the galactic pecking order. First-class citizens, who go wherever they please to do whatever they please, or pariahs, who seek fortune in unlikely places. The species who rarely come to the frontier are:{NEWLINE}- Ammonia-breathing bankers, who prefer to trade via Hypernet or representatives.{NEWLINE}- Heaviweight chalicotherium-like isolationists, who don't like to leave their planets.{NEWLINE}- Religious evangelists cepalopods.{NEWLINE}- Their lizard-like servants.{NEWLINE}- A hivemind of networked robots that kicked their owners out and occupy their planets."
  STR_HANAR: "Cephalopods"
  STR_HANAR_ARTICLE: "The only highly advanced non-humanoid species. Superficially they somewhat resemble Earth cephalopods, but biologically they are closer to box jellyfish.{NEWLINE}Their state is a moderate theocracy, worshipping ”Proto-Gods“. They tolerate others' views, but tend to preach compulsively.{NEWLINE}In early 1980s they conducted an unusual "
  STR_HANAR_ARTICLE: "Единственный высокоразвитый негуманоидный вид. Внешне отчасти напоминают земных головоногих, но биологически ближе к кубомедузам.{NEWLINE}Государственный строй — умеренная теократия, поклонение «прото-богам». Вполне терпимы к чужим взглядам, но склонны к навязчивым проповедям.{NEWLINE}В начале 1980-х провели необычную операцию по спасению нескольких сот тысяч «лягухов» с планеты, пострадавшей от ядерной войны.{NEWLINE}Неспособны подолгу находиться на воздухе или в воде неподходящей солёности и состава без дорогих систем жизнеобеспечения, что сдерживает колонизацию. Возможно, привычные к сухому климату «лягухи» поспособствуют их экспансии."
  # STR_DRELL: "Лягухи"
  STR_DRELL_ARTICLE: "Гуманоидные рептилии, хорошо приспособленные к пустынному климату, но плохо переносящие влажность. Уровень технологий родной планеты соответствует Земле.{NEWLINE}Около 20 лет назад экологический кризис на их планете спровоцировал ядерную войну. Головоноги эвакуировали менее 400 тысяч жителей на свою планету. Нынешний статус иммигрантов не вполне ясен. Очевидно, что вывезли их не из чистого альтруизма, но наиболее слезоточивые истории об эксплуатации беженцев оказались выдумкой журналив стодля поднятия рейтингов. Уже выросло первое поколение, родившееся в новом мире, но официально распространяемыеи истории успеха также следует принимать с поправкой на пропаганду.{NEWLINE}Предполагают, что лягухи должны помочь осваивать сухие планеты, но за 20 лет головоноги не основывали новых колоний."
# STR_TRAWLING_08: "Trawling: Galactic governments"
  STR_CITADEL: "Fortress"
  STR_CITADEL_ARTICLE: "Orbital station Fortress (rough translation) is the seat of galactic government and the biggest transport hub, thanks to numerous nearby teleporters. Its permanent population is 13 million people.{NEWLINE}It was built over 50 000 years ago by now-extinct “Proto-Gods” and rediscovered by Blues around 600 BCE. As new races discovered teleporter network, they eventually stumbled upon Fortress.{NEWLINE}Currently only 3 races form the ruling council: Blues, Horned and Birds. The rest suffer serious armament restrictions and have to obey laws passed without their consent. But this may be an acceptable price for galactic peace and stability.{NEWLINE}Discrepancy: Publicly available (and fullest existing) station plans leave out significant part of its volume. Why isn't the council afraid something may be hiding there?"
  # STR_TRAWLING_09: "Trawling: Solar system"
  STR_SOL_SYSTEM: "What Aliens Know of our System"
  STR_SOL_SYSTEM_ARTICLE: "We may be closer to the capital than half of other species, but Sol neighbourhood is an unclaimed wilderness. Proto-Gods may have left some teleporters around, but activating them requires decades of preparation, and starships are too slow to study that much volume.{NEWLINE}There exists a questionable list of likely Proto-God ruin locations, which includes Sun, but it's been shown to be partially wrong, and many dig sites are more conveniently located.{NEWLINE}Lately a group of companies tried to secure exclusive exploration and colonization rights for vast chunks of space, but couldn't afford lobbysts' bills. The one interested in Solar system was called Hyda Universal.{NEWLINE}There are rumours and unsubstantiated allegations of patrol fleets altering their routes to leave several teleporters in our area unattended."
  STR_HU: "Hyda Universal"
  STR_HU_ARTICLE: "Hyda Universal is a transnational conglomerate, which dabbles in prety much anything profitable. It's been involved in questionable  businesses for decades, but never enough to be disbanded, although several CEOs went to jail. Officially, HU has excavation permits for 2 Proto-Gods sites outside our system.{NEWLINE}Their corporate logo is present on some of equipment we captured."
  STR_BLOOD_PACK: "Carnage Troop"
  STR_BLOOD_PACK_ARTICLE: "'Carnage Troop' is a blanket term for loosely associated pirate and mercenary bands of Dinos and Spikies. Another possible translation would be 'bloodthirsty herd', implying a certain feral omnivore from Dinos' native planet. Technically, Carnage Troop is a private military company, which is banned from space of the 6 major powers and works in independent colonies and unclaimed areas.{NEWLINE}For the overwhelming majority of Dinos this is the only way to leave their hellhole of a planet. Spikies generally live on less hospitable planets doing dirty and dangerous jobs; many join volunteerly, but many are press-ganged.{NEWLINE}In theory most bands recognize the authority of a single Troop leader (always a Dino), but in practice each band minds their own business. The leader is elected by Hypernet vote for life, which means from a decade to just a few months. Such is the life expectancy of a warlord, who personally leads his troops in battle.{NEWLINE}HU did hire Troop to guard its ships and bases in unclaimed space, but cancelled the contract last year. Unconfirmed rumours say HU chose Troop solely for its inability to sell information to Horned intelligence, and cancelled when it did."
  # STR_TRAWLING_10: "Trawling: Ancient history"
  STR_PROTHEANS: "Proto-Gods"
  STR_PROTHEANS_ARTICLE: "In the distant past our galaxy was ruled by an advanced civilization of “Proto-Gods”. They built a network of teleporters witn Fortress as the central hub, then disappeared about 50 000 years ago. All present civilizations learned gravity manipulation and starship principles from their ruins.{NEWLINE}Their writing system is weird. Despite partial success as early as the 1st millenium BCE and huge corpus of materials, much of the translations is still guesswork.{NEWLINE}Supposedly they banned creation of artificial intelligence after they had to suppress a revolt of robots.{NEWLINE}No pictures of Proto-Gods were found. It's still unknown if their self-name referred to a single species or a multispecies state. The only known statue proved much older — about 125 000 years old.{NEWLINE}Several fringe theories maintain that at least part of the network is much older and Proto-Gods in turn learned from another extinct species. Lately this idea has been discredited by its less stable proponents and it's inadvisable to discuss it, unless you want to provoke a conflict.{NEWLINE}A contested translation of one document (sort of ledger) indicates a research center in our Solar system."
  # STR_TRAWLING_11: "Trawling: Alien PDA"
  STR_OMNITOOL_ANALYSIS: "All-Tool"
  STR_OMNITOOL_ANALYSIS_ARTICLE: "Literally 'tool for everything' or 'all-tool', this device is ubiquitous in any alien civilization. It is a portable computer, cell phone, identification device, digital wallet, multimedia entertainment center, sophisticated 3D printer(!!!!) and even a weapon! Every adult carries one of those. Even savage Spikies import them.{NEWLINE}The task of using a portable computer with makeshift translation software to download a manual and a programming guide was too much of a chicken-and-egg problem(!!!!). But we managed.{NEWLINE}Most importantly, it gives us access to all publicly available knowledge -- as long as we have Hypernet access -- and production capability of a one-man workshop -- as long as we have the materials."
  # STR_TRAWLING_12: "Trawling: Interstellar communication"
  STR_BUOYS: "Hypernet Buoys"
  STR_BUOYS_ARTICLE: "At short distances aliens communicate with electromagnetic radiation — radio and lasers. At longer distances, where light speed becomes an issue, they set a pair of trasievers that create a thread-like zone between them, where speed of light is accelerated. For interstellar distances inside developed clusters they set chains of such buoys. Finally, communication between clusters goes through accelerated lightspeed tunnels, created by matter transeivers — effectively, very powerful buoys."
  # STR_TRAWLING_13: "Trawling: Interstellar transportation"
  STR_ALIEN_PROPULSION: "Alien Propulsion"
  STR_ALIEN_PROPULSION_ARTICLE: "Alien craft engines create a bubble of a field, that changes (increases or decreases) mass (both inertial and gravitational) of everything inside it as well as the speed of light. There seems to be no lower limit on the craft size, but ships longer than a few kilometers are deemed impactical. The engines accumulate static charge over time and interstellar ships need occasional stops  for discharging, preferably at a gas giant.{NEWLINE}A faster means of travel is what we misnamed a Proto-God teleporter gate in “cannon” mode. It can briefly create a tunnel of low mass and accelerated lightspeed and throw the ship through. All known “cannons” have the limit of several hundred light years. Of course, this is one-way. The ship has to return under its own power or seek another cannon.{NEWLINE}The fastest way are matched pairs of teleporter gates in “transiever” mode. They allow near-instant jumps at any distance within the galaxy. As well as connecting Hypernet segments.{NEWLINE}Galactic colonization goes in “clusters” tied to transiever hubs. Fortunately, Proto-Gods usually built their gates in systems with multiple habitable planets nearby.{NEWLINE}Prisoners mentioned activation of a transiever in our Solar system."
  STR_MASS_EFFECT: "Electrogravity"
  STR_MASS_EFFECT_ARTICLE: "All alien mass-altering technology is built around one phenomenon. When electric charge is applied to a certain substance ('zeroth element') it starts interacting with dark energy. Depending on the charge, the mass increases or decreases.{NEWLINE}The substance supposedly forms in supernova explosions. There are no known deposits in the Solar system, but there are alien warehouses for emergency repairs."
  STR_LOCAL_TRANSIEVER: "Nearest Matter Transiever"
  STR_LOCAL_TRANSIEVER_ARTICLE: "Prisoners indicate that the matter transiever connecting our system to the galactic network orbits a small planet several light hours from Sun. Probably in the Kuiper Belt. Questioning starship captain, navigator or pilot may reveal more."
  STR_CHARON_COVERUP: "Charon Cover-up"
  STR_CHARON_COVERUP_ARTICLE: "We found the gate to our home system — it's Charon, the sattelite of Pluto. It is far enough from Earth to make unnoticable the ice that fell off when the transiever was activated. But a ship passing through transiever causes an ultraviolet flash. Aliens have created a network of agents paying astronomers to make sure nopody looks at Pluto when ships arrie or depart.{NEWLINE}Capture of Blue agents working on Earth wil help our cause greatly."
  # STR_TRAWLING_14: "Trawling: Artificial intelligence"
  STR_AI: "Artificial Intelligence"
  STR_AI_ARTICLE: "Artificial intelligence is illegal. One of the few confirmed facts about Proto-Gods is that they once created free-thinking robots, then had to fight a war against them. Modern civilizations followed suit and outlawed artificial intelligence. What they have instead is “virtual intelligence” programs, which seem to be a good heuristic imitation.{NEWLINE}A few centuries ago Hazmats tried to work around the ban by employing “swarm intelligences”, where each individual program passed the restrictions, but a swarm could do tasks too complex for a legal program. Eventually, swarms formed a hivemind that kicked its former masters off their planets.{NEWLINE}Perhaps, we should learn from their example and avoid creating programs, which behaviour we can't predict. At least, until we solve the halting problem."
  STR_SEO: "Search Engine Optimization"
  STR_SEO_ARTICLE: "Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to methods affecting the visibility of network sites in the search engine output. On Earth we already have such phenomenon as 'Internet search spam'. Hypernet has been the war zone of search engines and optimizers for millennia. Sometimes literally -- during the war against Dinos the net was full of propaganda and counter-propaganda that occasionally made a difference.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Today it's the kind of stalemate where everyone has to run to stay in place. Heuristic intelligences find new ways to write pages indistinguishable from legitimately valuable information and other heuristic intelligences find ways to filter them. And programmers on both sides keep improving them."
  # STR_TRAWLING_15: "Trawling: Cold fusion"
  STR_COLD_FUSION: "Cold Fusion"
  STR_COLD_FUSION_ARTICLE: "Cold fusion does not exist. Every success in this field in the last 3000 years eventually proved to be a mistake or a fraud.{NEWLINE}However, there are such things as “hot fusion”, which is a highly efficient reactor design that imitates conditions deep inside a star, and considerably cooler “warm fusion”, which is the most common kind of a ship reactor."
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR: "Alien Ship Reactor"
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR_ARTICLE: "Most alien ships use helium-3 fusion reactors as the source of energy. Helium-3 is usually pumped out of gas giants, but can be extracted from any rocky atmosphere-free planet close to its star. Like our Moon.{NEWLINE}The reactor can be easily reproduced with Earth materials, albeit significantly bigger. Since it's beyond the scope of our mission, we are transferring the plans to higher command and letting them decide who will build it.{NEWLINE}Fun fact: Birds sell their millennium-old giant warships to use as helium depots."
  # STR_TRAWLING_16: "Trawling: Superconductors"
  STR_HTSC: "High-Temperature Superconductors"
  STR_HTSC_ARTICLE: "High-temperature superconductors were the second biggest scientific hype of 1980s, they pushed our technologies decades ahead, but in the end didn't quite live up to the expectations. To think that our cuprate research came this close to the galatic bleeding edge technology, only to stop two steps from the goal! Granted, we still know next to nothing about solid-state non-equilibrium cyclic kinetics, but we should at least have tried!{NEWLINE}Back to the practical side of things. With the downloaded data any workshop can create superconducting ceramics and composite wire, that stay superconductive up to 800⁰C and can store more energy than any non-nuclear fuel or explosive. Small-scale production will give lower quality than large-scale one, but it'll do for us. The price, however, is high."
  STR_SMES: "Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage"
  STR_SMES_ARTICLE: "Superconducting solenoids and toroids can store more energy (per weight and volume) than any non-nuclear fuel or explosive. Since they no longer need cryonic systems, then can be made human-portable and even bullet-sized. The only limit is physical durability. The portable energy banks are fine, but experimental bullets and demolition charges keep breaking under magnetic strain. If aliens can work with such energies, did they find a way to stand such strains?"
  # STR_TRAWLING_17: "Trawling: Construction materials"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS: "Alien Alloys and Composites"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_ARTICLE: "We've seen their achievements, and we are disappointed. The strongest interatomic bond they use is still carbon-carbon, and square-cube law is as merciless as ever. Aliens still cannot create giant humanoid battle robots.{NEWLINE}Their most significant achievement is giving every material the ability to “heal” microscopic cracks, preventing their growth and effectively increasing durability manyfold.{NEWLINE}Unfortunately for us, manufacturing advanced materials requires building the whole production chain with expensive infrastructure. That would take too much time and money and attract undesired attention. For the same reason we can't outsource it. The only remaining option for now is reusing materials from captured devices and wrecks."
  STR_OMNIGEL: "Scrap"
  STR_OMNIGEL_ARTICLE: "Alien PDAs are surprisingly capable of recycling common alien materials into new devices. In fact, all alien materials seem to have been developed with this mode of operation in mind. This would allow our workshops to manufacture alien devices from captured and reverse-engineered plans."
  STR_SMES_WEAPONS: "SMES Weapons"
  STR_SMES_WEAPONS_ARTICLE: "Replacing bullets in regular Earth ammunition with superconducting toroid solenoids isn't hard. Upon impact they shatter and release stored energy. The tricky part was converting all the energy of electromagnetic pulse into heat and kinetic energy of expanding gas. But we managed. Golden bulets would've been cheaper, though.{NEWLINE}More often than not, TNT equivalent of 1-2 kg per bullet is an overkill. We developed ammunition with several different yields.{NEWLINE}Be aware that while your ammo is more powerful, your weapons range and precision didn't change. We'll try to adapt alien rail weapons for new bullets."
  STR_SMES_RAIL_WEAPONS: "Hybrid SMES Weapons"
  STR_SMES_RAIL_WEAPONS_ARTICLE: "We've taught replicators of alien rail weapons to manufacture SMES bullets. This gives us higher precision and virtually unlimited ammo.  Although superior technology alows making more compact solenouds, they still are weaker than 14-mm SMES machineguns."

  STR_BIOTICS: "Telekinesis"
  STR_BIOTICS_ARTICLE: "Telekinesis does exist, and it uses the same principles as electrogravity that powers starships. If an embryo gets a chronic poisoning with 'zeroth element', doesn't die, and enough E0 is embedded in its nervous system, the organism becomes able to manipulate gravity by applying electricity to those E0 grains. For Blues the process is natural, but other species require implanting a special electronic device.{NEWLINE}'Bio-kinesis' tends to be crude, but strong -- lifting a ton is easier than brushing teeth. Combat applications include a protective gravity wall (effectively a skin-tight force field barrier), pushing and pulling enemies, throwing objects at them, shredding enemies with gravity oscillations(?), creating a short-lived attractor that pulls everything toward itself and, supposedly, short-range (several metres) teleportation.{NEWLINE}Galactic technology is unable to duplicate any of those effects with comparable precision, save for the force field bubble. It is also unable to give this ability to an adult (that is, without health or mental complications), despite millennia of trying. What they did figure out is a way to nullify all active bio-kinetic abilities, which helps keeping bio-kinetic prisoners in line."
  STR_BIOTIC_CONTAINMENT: "Telekinetic Containment"
  STR_BIOTIC_CONTAINMENT_ARTICLE: "Any all-tool is able to fabricate single-use devices that give a burst disruptive to telekinesis. The effect is unpleasant to anybody practicing telekinesis, but mostly harmless. Such defences in a cell block will stop any escape attempts and finally allow us to study telekinetic prisoners."
  STR_MIND_MELD: "Telepathy"
  STR_MIND_MELD_ARTICLE: "All Blues have a limited telepathic ability. They can send and recieve information non-verbally when in contact with another being's head. They also use it for recreational sex.{NEWLINE}This technique would allow extracting information from brains without a subject's consent, but aliens see this line of research as highly immoral. On the other hand, comparing human and Blue brains wouldn't hurt."
  STR_HUMAN_ASARI_NEURAL: "Human-Blue Comparative Neurophysiology"
  STR_HUMAN_ASARI_NEURAL_ARTICLE: "We were studying Blues' brains with MRT and comparing them to humans. Thanks to all resources provided, in passing we had figured out how to read recent perceived images -- in effect, surface thoughts. Developing the technique took a high-resolution tomograph, a Xeon cluster, a 20-layer neural network, several human volunteers, several Blues and a lot of photos. Using it requires just a tomographer and a K6 desktop PC. An alien 'all-tool' can easily fabricate an extension module for the same purpose.{NEWLINE}Council member states now have a useful instrument for humane questioning of uncooperative suspects -- or unconscious witnesses.(+500 score){NEWLINE}The only problem is -- if the suspects manages to avoid thinking of something, there's no way to look deeper. Unless a Blue telepath extracts the knowledge -- but they would never do something as immoral willingly."

  STR_INVISIBILITY_ARTICLE: "The idea to hide an object by wrapping it in material, that makes light circumnavigate it, isn't new on Earth. Apparently the aliens achieved some success by bending light with gravity.{NEWLINE}The technology scales poorly -- it can barely cover a single human, but not even a car -- and all devices suffer from fast heat buildup -- a human-sized object can stay invisible no longer than several seconds."
  STR_BLUESHIFT: "Stealth in Space"
  STR_BLUESHIFT_ARTICLE: "The invisibility technology cannot scale to starship size, but this is largely unnecessary. Space is vast and a ship is like a grain of sand. The only thing that can betray it is its infrared emission. At faster than light speeds infrared becomes ultraviolet and the ship becomes easy to notice -- if you know what to look for. A lot of researchers are creating new ways to reduce IR emissions, but all existing ships should be detectable by simple Earth instruments."

  #STR_CLONING: "Cloning"
  #STR_CLONING_ARTICLE: "Earth science has figured out cloning in the middle of the 20th century. There were successful experiments with frogs, but the small size of mammal ovum (egg cell) was an obstacle, overcome only recently. The process requires a donor's ovum and a surrogate mother, takes as much time as growing a baby naturally and may lead to health defects due to damage to the genetic material being cloned.{NEWLINE}According to Hypernet, the latter hypothesis proved right. Adult DNA outside gametes (non-somatic cells) is damaged as the organism ages, and reversing the process riscs causing cancer. The lowest risc species all come from the planet of Dinos, where all organisms don't age, quickly mature physically (not mentally, though) and regenerate wery well, thanks to gene redundancy with voting.{NEWLINE}Technology to quickly clone and grow adult organisms do exist, but doing that to sentients is illegal, since it would require programming their brains. The ban seems to be pre-emptive, since we found no information of working brain programming methods."

The modification process is a serious challenge to Earth technology, but nothing impossible.{NEWLINE}But even that is unnecessary — we've captured samples of production-ready cultures. The reason HU continues to experiment with Earth ungulates is that galactic laws find this degree of genetic modifications unsafe and prohibit its commercialization.

They owe several months worth to most large Hypernet providers. To send a letter, we need an encrypted communication terminal (so-called 'governmental'), which is often installed at large ships and bases.

  STR_QUARIAN_PIRATE_1990_ARTICLE: "About 10 years ago pirates tried to board one of large habitable Homeless Ships. Since it happened far from inhabited planets and Hazmat contacts with the rest of the galaxy are fairly limited, nobody would've known if it wasn't for the show execution of pirates. Even so, the information is quite limited and most of it is derived from circumstantial evidence and guesswork. The only reliable fact is that Hazmats hastily and without haggling purchased weapons and materials to repair ships and live support. Several questions are especially interesting:{NEWLINE}Why a normally well-guarded liveship was left without escort?{NEWLINE}How did pirates with a single frigate strength expect to capture a ship with a million population?{NEWLINE}Why did banks ignore their rule to never credit HS?{NEWLINE}Why didn't pirates attack again during the repairs?

Hazmat government was to stop theft of our resourses and forget about our system, since their actions clearly violate Fortress laws.{NEWLINE}The Homeless Ships command called the theft the actions of a group of non-citizens outside their control and made two better offers.{NEWLINE}1. They can take prisoners, pay 'a reasonable compensation' for our silence and never return. Apparently, the galaxy reaction on this theft scares them even more than early contact scares us.{NEWLINE}2.

Highly technologically advanced species who don't obey Fortress and keep kidnapping its citizens. Supposedly, for biological research. Officially, their existence is denied and their actions are attributed to pirates. Our source confirmed that the boarders were hired by Amassers as cannon fodder and were covered by their fire.
