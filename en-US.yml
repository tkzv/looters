  STR_BATARIAN_ARTICLE: "4-eyed humanoids. Despite an extra pair of eyes, the rest of the body looks surprisingly human. Physically, they are about as strong as an average human soldier. 4-eyed captives are grumpy and uncooperative, prone to attack both X-COM personnel and 2-eyed inmates. Attempts to learn their language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_SALARIAN_ARTICLE: "Upright-walking horned frogs. Physically weaker and frailer than humans or any other aliens, but excellent marksmen. Inquisitive and fast, they will try to capture weapons and escape an the first opportunity. The captives have quickly picked up several human words, but we still can't communicate beyond simplest commands and requests. Their language is either incomprehensibly difficult, or they are pulling our leg.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE: "Ugly sharp-toothed humanoids. Compensate poor aim with a lot of bullets. Their wounds heal very fast, but they aren't much more durable than humans. Uncooperative and aggressive, but easily intimidated with force. Attempts to learn their language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_QUARIAN_ARTICLE: "Lean human-sized humanoids wearing hazmat suits with opaque vizors. Their weapons pose formidable resistance, but they surrender easily. However, they will fight with renewed vigor, when we try to open their suits."
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE: "Blue-skinned humanoids extremelly similar to human women, save for rigid head tentacles. With wigs and body paint they can easily pass up as humans.{NEWLINE}Those witches are extremelly attractive to BOTH genders. And they know it! Prisoners have repeatedly tried to initiate intimate contact and grab guards by the head and had to be discouraged with non-lethal force.{NEWLINE}All specimen manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE: "Humanoids, if you stretch the definition to a creature with non-functional flat mandibles, bird-like hands and feet,  and covered with armor plates. They tend to be armed better than most aliens and demonstrate best combat skills. Physically they are a match to a human in peak physical condition.{NEWLINE}Prisoners have tried to communicate something desperately. When that failed due to language barrier, they started a hunger strike.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE: "Those humanoid dinosaurs are very strong and deceptively fast. They quickly regenerate and can stand a lot of punishment. A single dino can carry an arsenal big enough to down an air wing and armour to match an APC. Communication attempts yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}A warning to guards: do not try to beat them! Dinos seem to mistake it for a sparring invitation. Just shoot them -- they'll get the point faster that way. {NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_AGUNS: "Alien Kinetic Weapons"
  STR_AGUNS_ARTICLE: "Despite their technological superiority aliens still employ kinetic weapons. Albeit their guns are collapsible, muzzle velocity is hypersonic and ammunition load is estimated above 50 000 shots. They seem to use electromagnetic acceleration, but we have no clue about the power source.{NEWLINE}No two guns are alike (replicator-manufactured on the spot?), but they all fall into 5 categories roughly equivalent to our pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles.{NEWLINE}They all possess intuitive point-and-click interface without any sign of ID locks. Our operatives should have no trouble using them."
  STR_OMNITOOL: "Alien PDA."
  STR_OMNITOOL_ARTICLE: "This forearm-mounted device is an alien PDA/communicator/replicator. We\'ve successfuly built an EMP grenade that burned all computers in the room (insurance claim forms attached) and a silicon blade Dr.Mbayo stabbed himself with (by accident). We'll postpone further investigation until we can read the alien language."
  STR_HYPERNET: "Hypernet"
  STR_HYPERNET_ARTICLE: "The major means of interstellar communication are chains of buoys that create zones of accelerated lightspeed between them. For longer distances buoys connect to relays. The galaxy is covered by a global network a lot like our Internet. Fidonet too, considerind its heterogenity and lags.{NEWLINE}Search tools are surprisingly useless, far below Veronica or even Altavista, but we can use them as a starting point and ask around. We've already came up with about 20 topics to research. All it takes is an alien PDA and some time."

  STR_TRAWLING_LAST: "Hypernet Ban"
  STR_TRAWLING_LAST_ARTICLE: "We've been banned for, quote, 'unfunny trolling with feigned ignorance' at every public board we posted to. Enraged subscribers started a campaign to identify our collective alias. Under such pressure Hypernet providers have blacklisted our exit node. Unless HU bothers changing its address, the rest of Hypernet will remain inaccessible from this segment. Only HU-owned nodes are currently accessible from Earth, which suits HU security just fine."
