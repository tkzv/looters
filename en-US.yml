  STR_BATARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "4-eyed humanoids. Despite an extra pair of eyes, the rest of the body looks surprisingly human. Physically, they are about as strong as an average human soldier. 4-eyed captives are grumpy and uncooperative, prone to attack both X-COM personnel and 2-eyed inmates. Attempts to teach them any human language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_SALARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Upright-walking bug-eyed horned frogs. Physically weaker and frailer than humans or any other aliens, but excellent marksmen. Often throw various grenades, such as incendiary or EMP. Inquisitive and fast, they will try to steal weapons and escape an the first opportunity. The captives have quickly picked up several human words, but we still can't communicate beyond simplest commands and requests. Their language is either incomprehensibly difficult, or they are pulling our leg.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE_1: "Ugly sharp-toothed humanoids. They compensate poor aim with bursts and volleys. Their wounds heal very fast, but they aren't much more durable than humans. Uncooperative and aggressive, but easily intimidated with superior force. Attempts to teach them our language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_QUARIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Lean human-sized humanoids wearing hazmat suits with opaque vizors. Their automated defences weapons are formidable, but they surrender easily without them. However, they will fight with renewed vigor, when we try to open their suits.{NEWLINE}These aliens refuse to eat any food besides what they carried upon themselves. If we can't figure out their problem, we'd have to transfer them upstairs, where they can be force-fed. Of course, our scientists won't be able to study them there."
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE_1: "Blue-skinned humanoids extremelly similar to human women, if you forget rigid head tentacles. With wigs and body paint they can easily pass up as humans.{NEWLINE}Those witches are extremelly attractive to BOTH genders. And they know it! Prisoners have repeatedly tried to initiate some intimate hugging with guards and grab the guard's neck while at it. They had to be discouraged with non-lethal measures.{NEWLINE}All specimen manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE_1: "Humanoids, if you stretch the definition to a creature covered with armor plates, with non-functional flat mandibles, bird-like hands and feet and a beakless parrot head (featherless, but crested). They tend to be armed better than most aliens and demonstrate best combat skills. Physically they are a match to a human in peak physical condition.{NEWLINE}Prisoners have desperately tried to communicate something. When that failed due to language barrier, they started a hunger strike.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE_1: "Those humanoid dinosaurs are very strong and surprisingly fast. They quickly regenerate and can stand a lot of punishment. A single dino can carry an arsenal big enough to down an air wing and armour to match an APC. Communication attempts yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}A warning to guards: do not try to beat them! Dinos seem to mistake it for a sparring invitation -- without an intent to kill, but still dangerously lethal due to their strength. Just shoot them -- they'll get the point faster that way.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_DRELL_ARTICLE_1: "A lean green lizard-like alien, who surrendered to us. He(?) speaks English and desires to speak with X-COM high command. We need to study him further to decide."
  STR_AGUNS: "Alien Kinetic Weapons"
  STR_AGUNS_ARTICLE: "Despite their technological superiority aliens still employ kinetic weapons. Albeit their guns are collapsible, muzzle velocity is hypersonic and ammunition load is estimated above 50 000 shots. They seem to use electromagnetic acceleration, but we have no clue about the power source.{NEWLINE}No two guns are alike (replicator-manufactured on the spot?), but they all fall into 4 categories roughly equivalent to our pistols/SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles.{NEWLINE}They all possess intuitive point-and-click interface without any hint of ID locks. Our operatives should have no trouble using them."
  STR_OMNITOOL: "Alien PDA."
  STR_OMNITOOL_ARTICLE: "This deice is forearm-mounted. It is an alien PDA/communicator/replicator. We've successfuly employed it to build an EMP grenade that burned all computers in the room (insurance claim forms attached) and a silicon blade Dr.Mbayo stabbed himself with (by accident). We paused further investigation until we can read the alien language."
  STR_HYPERNET: "Hypernet"
  STR_HYPERNET_ARTICLE: "A global network we dubbed “Hypernet” encompasses the whole galaxy. We have no idea how supralight communication works, but the end result is a lot like our Internet. Or Fidonet, considerind its heterogenity and lags.{NEWLINE}Search tools are surprisingly useless, far below Veronica or even Altavista. But we can use them as a starting point and ask around. We've already came up with about 20 topics to research. All it takes is an alien PDA and some time."

  STR_TRAWLING_LAST: "Hypernet Ban"
  STR_TRAWLING_LAST_ARTICLE: "We've been banned for, quote, “unfunny trolling with feigned ignorance” at every public board we posted to. Enraged subscribers started a hunt against us, seeing our collective alias as a single person. They wrote multiple complaints to Hypernet providers. Under such pressure providers have blacklisted our exit node. Unless HU bothers changing its address, the rest of Hypernet will remain inaccessible from this segment. Only HU-owned nodes are currently accessible from Solar System, which suits their security service just fine.{NEWLINE}Some people just can't stand innocent questions about their system of values."
  STR_COLD_FUSION: "Cold Fusion"
  STR_COLD_FUSION_ARTICLE: "Cold fusion does not exist. Every success in this field in the last 3000 years eventually proved to be a mistake or a fraud.{NEWLINE}However, there are such things as “hot fusion”, which is a highly efficient reactor design that imitates conditions deep inside a star, and considerably cooler “warm fusion”, which is the most common kind of a ship reactor."
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR: "Alien Ship Reactor"
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR_ARTICLE: "Most alien ships use helium-3 fusion reactors as the source of energy. Helium-3 is usually pumped out of gas giants, but can be extracted from any rocky atmosphere-free planet close to its star. Like our Moon.{NEWLINE}The reactor can be easily reproduced with Earth materials, albeit significantly bigger. Since it's beyond the scope of our mission, we are transferring the plans upstairs and letting them decide who will build it.{NEWLINE}Fun fact: Birds sell their millennium-old giant warships to use as helium depots."
  STR_BATARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The 4-eyed aliens are the second to last civilization to enter the galactic stage. They are widely despised by their neighbours for their archaic society organization, primarily for caste system and slavery. Their government frequently announces and starts ambitious projects, which they can never afford. None of that improves their respectability. Which only adds grumpiness.{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, they are our closest neighbours. If their colonization program budget wasn't embezzled several times in a row, they would have found Earth around 1500 CE. "
  STR_SALARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The horned aliens are a race of short-living geniuses. The successful ones acheive more in 40 years than many do in centuries. They hold a seat in a ruling galactic council, and their intelligence network gets its due fear and respect.{NEWLINE}The ones typically working for HU are losers who can't get a job in a more civilized place with a less disreputable employee. Typical occupations include: scientist, technician and mercenary engineer."
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE_2: "The Spikies descend from savages 'saved' from their homeworld and transplanted to other planets. While mentally on par with humans and most aliens, Spikies live only 20 years and hardly have time for proper education. Most don't bother. These days the majority are employed as canon fodder by cheaper mercenary outfits.{NEWLINE}Their unique biology -- large, but non-replenishable pool of stem cells -- allows individuals to adapt to harsh environment by altering their organs. For all we know, some of them may survive on Mars for hours without suits."
  STR_QUARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The hazmats are the youngest civilization, discovering interstellar flight in the 18th century. For a while they were developing faster than anybody else -- mainly in the electronics field -- but then disaster struck. A network of electronic machinery suddenly gained sentience and kicked its creators off their planets. They were forced to wander the galaxy in dilapidated ships. We hypothesize that lack of vitamins from their homeworld weakens their immune systems (not unlike AIDS). They have to remain suited at all times, even on board of their ships."
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE_2: "Blues are a monogendered race that can crossbreed with 'anything with a brain'. There's a social stigma to those, who marry inside their own species, but the reasoning we found is contradictory. Everybody is telekinetic and has limited telepathic abilities. We speculate that their universal attractiveness also stems from telepathy, not necessaryly conscious."
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE_2: "Birds are the council enforcers. Their military might is unsurpassed."
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE_2: "In the distant past Dinos were uplifted from industrial age to become the council enforcers. Several centuries later their uncontrolled breeding prompted a war for living space. Right now their majority -- around 1 billion -- are confined to their unhospitable homeworld, and the few that leave it are mercenaries."
  STR_OTHER_ALIENS: "Aliens Unlikely to Appear"
  STR_OTHER_ALIENS_ARTICLE: "The alien species we may encounter come from top and bottom of the galactic pecking order. First-class citizens, who go wherever they please, or pariahs, who seek fortune in unlikely places. The species who rarely come to the frontier are:{NEWLINE}- Ammonia-breathing bankers, who prefer to trade via Hypernet or representatives.{NEWLINE}- Heaviweight chalicotherium-like isolationists, who prefer to stay on ther planets.{NEWLINE}- Religious evangelists cepalopods.{NEWLINE}- Their lizard-like servants.{NEWLINE}- A hivemind of networked robots that kicked their creators out and stay in the same systems."
  STR_CITADEL: "Fortress"
  STR_CITADEL_ARTICLE: "Orbital station Fortress (rough translation) is the seat of galactic government and the biggest transport hub, thanks to numerous nearby teleporters. Its permanent population is 13 million people.{NEWLINE}It was built over 50 000 years ago by now-extinct “Proto-Gods” and rediscovered by Blues around 600 BCE. As new races discovered teleporter network, they eventually stumbled upon Fortress.{NEWLINE}Currently only 3 races form the ruling council: Blues, Horned and Birds. The rest suffer serious armament restrictions and have to obey laws passed without their consent. But this may be a fair price for galactic peace and stability.{NEWLINE}Discrepancy: Available station plans leave out significant part of its volume. Why isn't the council afraid something may be hiding on its station?"
  STR_SOL_SYSTEM: "What Aliens Know of our System"
  STR_SOL_SYSTEM_ARTICLE: "We may be closer to the capital than half of other species, but our neighbourhood is an unclaimed wilderness. Proto-Gods may have left some teleporters around, but activating them requires decades of preparation, and starships are too slow to study that much volume.{NEWLINE}There exists a questionable list of likely Proto-God ruin locations, which includes Sun, but it's been shown to be partially wrong, and many dig sites are more conveniently located.{NEWLINE}There are rumours and unsubstantiated allegations of patrol fleets altering their routes to leave several teleporters in our area unattended."
  STR_HU: "Hyda Universal"
  STR_HU_ARTICLE: "Hyda Universal is a transnational conglomerate, which dabbles in prety much everything profitable. It's been involved in questionable  business for decades, but never enough to be disbanded. Officially, HU has excavation permits for 2 Proto-Gods sites outside our system.{NEWLINE}Their corporate logo is present on some of the captured equipment. "
  STR_PROTHEANS: "Proto-Gods"
  STR_PROTHEANS_ARTICLE: "In the distant past our galaxy was ruled by an advanced civilization of 'Proto-Gods'. They built a network of teleporters witn Fortress as the central hub, then disappeared about 50 000 years ago. All present civilizations learned gravity manipulation and starship principles from their ruins.{NEWLINE}Their writing system is weird. Despite partial success in the 1st millenium BCE and huge corpus of materials, much of the translations is still guesswork.{NEWLINE}No pictures of Proto-Gods were found. It's still unknown if their self-name referred to a single species or a multispecies state. The only known statue proved much older -- about 125 000 years old.{NEWLINE}Conspiracy theorists maintain that at least part of the network is much older and Proto-Gods in turn learned from another extinct species. This theory has been thoroghly discredited and it's unadvisable to discuss it, unless you want to provoke a conflict.{NEWLINE}A contested translation of one document (sort of ledger) indicates a research center in our Solar system."
  STR_TRAWLING_11: "Trawling: Alien PDA"
  STR_TRAWLING_12: "Trawling: Interstellar communication"
  STR_BUOYS: "Hypernet Buoys"
  STR_BUOYS_ARTICLE: "At short distances aliens communicate with electromagnetic radiation -- radio and lasers. At longer distances, where light speed becomes an issue, they set a pair of trasievers that create a thread-like zone between them, where speed of light is accelerated. For interstellar distances inside developed clusters they set chains of such buoys. Finally, communication between clusters goes through accelerated lightspeed tunnels, created by matter transeivers -- effectively, very powerful buoys.
  STR_TRAWLING_13: "Trawling: Interstellar transportation"
  STR_ALIEN_PROPULSION: "Alien Propulsion"
  STR_ALIEN_PROPULSION_ARTICLE: "Alien craft engines create a field, that changes (increases or decreases) mass (both inertial and gravitational) of everything inside it and also changes speed of light. There seems to be no lower limit on the craft size, but ships longer than a few kilometers are deemed impactical. The engines accumulate static charge over time and interstellar ships need occasional stops  for discharging, preferably at a gas giant.{NEWLINE}A faster means of travel is what we misnamed a Proto-God teleporter gate in 'cannon' mode. It can briefly create a tunnel of accelerated lightspeed and throw the ship through. All known 'cannons' have the limit of several hundred light years. Of course, this is one-way. The ship has to return under its own power or seek another cannon.{NEWLINE}The fastest way is a matched pair of teleporter gates in 'transiever' mode. This allows near-instant travel within the galaxy with no distance limit. As well as connecting Hypernet segments.{NEWLINE}Galactic colonization goes in 'clusters' built around transiever hubs. Fortunately, Proto-Gods usually built their gates in systems with multiple habitable planets nearby.{NEWLINE}Prisoners mentioned activating a transiever in our Solar system."
  STR_LOCAL_TRANSIEVER: "Nearest Matter Transiever"
  STR_LOCAL_TRANSIEVER_ARTICLE: "Prisoners indicate that the matter transiever connecting our system to the galactic network orbits a small planet several light hours from Sun. Probably in the Kuiper Belt. "
