  STR_BATARIAN_ARTICLE: "4-eyed humanoids. Despite an extra pair of eyes, the rest of the body looks surprisingly human. Physically, they are about as strong as an average human soldier. 4-eyed captives are grumpy and uncooperative, prone to attack both X-COM personnel and 2-eyed inmates. Attempts to teach them any human language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_SALARIAN_ARTICLE: "Upright-walking horned frogs. Physically weaker and frailer than humans or any other aliens, but excellent marksmen. Inquisitive and fast, they will try to capture weapons and escape an the first opportunity. The captives have quickly picked up several human words, but we still can't communicate beyond simplest commands and requests. Their language is either incomprehensibly difficult, or they are pulling our leg.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_VORCHA_ARTICLE: "Ugly sharp-toothed humanoids. They compensate poor aim with bursts and volleys. Their wounds heal very fast, but they aren't much more durable than humans. Uncooperative and aggressive, but easily intimidated with superior force. Attempts to teach them our language or learn theirs yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_QUARIAN_ARTICLE: "Lean human-sized humanoids wearing hazmat suits with opaque vizors. Their automated defences weapons are formidable, but they surrender easily without them. However, they will fight with renewed vigor, when we try to open their suits."
  STR_ASARI_ARTICLE: "Blue-skinned humanoids extremelly similar to human women, if you forget rigid head tentacles. With wigs and body paint they can easily pass up as humans.{NEWLINE}Those witches are extremelly attractive to BOTH genders. And they know it! Prisoners have repeatedly tried to initiate some intimate hugging with guards and grab guards by the head while at it. They had to be discouraged with non-lethal measures.{NEWLINE}All specimen manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_TURIAN_ARTICLE: "Humanoids, if you stretch the definition to a creature with non-functional flat mandibles, bird-like hands and feet,  and covered with armor plates. They tend to be armed better than most aliens and demonstrate best combat skills. Physically they are a match to a human in peak physical condition.{NEWLINE}Prisoners have tried to communicate something desperately. When that failed due to language barrier, they started a hunger strike.{NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_KROGAN_ARTICLE: "Those humanoid dinosaurs are very strong and surprisingly fast. They quickly regenerate and can stand a lot of punishment. A single dino can carry an arsenal big enough to down an air wing and armour to match an APC. Communication attempts yielded nothing so far.{NEWLINE}A warning to guards: do not try to beat them! Dinos seem to mistake it for a sparring invitation -- without an intent to kill, but still dangerously lethal due to their strength. Just shoot them -- they'll get the point faster that way. {NEWLINE}Several percent manifest telekinetic powers and require special containment procedures."
  STR_AGUNS: "Alien Kinetic Weapons"
  STR_AGUNS_ARTICLE: "Despite their technological superiority aliens still employ kinetic weapons. Albeit their guns are collapsible, muzzle velocity is hypersonic and ammunition load is estimated above 50 000 shots. They seem to use electromagnetic acceleration, but we have no clue about the power source.{NEWLINE}No two guns are alike (replicator-manufactured on the spot?), but they all fall into 4 categories roughly equivalent to our pistols/SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles.{NEWLINE}They all possess intuitive point-and-click interface without any рште of any ID locks. Our operatives should have no trouble using them."
  STR_OMNITOOL: "Alien PDA."
  STR_OMNITOOL_ARTICLE: "This deice is forearm-mounted. It is an alien PDA/communicator/replicator. We've successfuly employed it to build an EMP grenade that burned all computers in the room (insurance claim forms attached) and a silicon blade Dr.Mbayo stabbed himself with (by accident). We paussed further investigation until we can read the alien language."
  STR_HYPERNET: "Hypernet"
  STR_HYPERNET_ARTICLE: "A global network we dubbed “Hypernet” encompasses the whole galaxy. We have no idea how supralight communication works, but the end result is a lot like our Internet. Or Fidonet, considerind its heterogenity and lags.{NEWLINE}Search tools are surprisingly useless, far below Veronica or even Altavista. But we can use them as a starting point and ask around. We've already came up with about 20 topics to research. All it takes is an alien PDA and some time."
# "The major means of interstellar communication are chains of buoys that create thread-like zones of accelerated lightspeed between each pair. For longer distances buoys connect through3 relays. The galaxy is covered by a global network a lot like our Internet. Fidonet too, considerind its heterogenity and lags.{NEWLINE}Search tools are surprisingly useless, far below Veronica or even Altavista, but we can use them as a starting point and ask around. We've already came up with about 20 topics to research. All it takes is an alien PDA and some time."

  STR_TRAWLING_LAST: "Hypernet Ban"
  STR_TRAWLING_LAST_ARTICLE: "We've been banned for, quote, “unfunny trolling with feigned ignorance” at every public board we posted to. Enraged subscribers started a hunt against us, seeing our collective alias as a single person. They wrote multiple ccomplaints to providers. Under such pressure Hypernet providers have blacklisted our exit node. Unless HU bothers changing its address, the rest of Hypernet will remain inaccessible from this segment. Only HU-owned nodes are currently accessible from Solar System, which suits their security service just fine.{NEWLINE}Some people just can't stand innocent questions about their system of values."
  STR_CITADEL: "Fortress"
  STR_CITADEL_ARTICLE: "Orbital station Fortress is the seat of galactic government and the biggest transport hub, thanks to numerous mass relays nearby. Its permanent population is 13 million people.{NEWLINE}It was built over 50 000 years ago by now-extinct “Proto-Gods” and rediscovered by Blues around 1000 BCE. As new races discovered mass relay network, they eventually stumbled upon Fortress.{NEWLINE}Currently only 3 races form the ruling council: Blues, Bug-eyed and Birds. The rest suffer serious restrictions on fleet sizes and have to obey laws passed without their consent.{NEWLINE}Discrepancy: Available station plans leave out significant part of its volume. Why isn't the council afraid something may be hiding on its station?"
  STR_COLD_FUSION: "Cold Fusion"
  STR_COLD_FUSION_ARTICLE: "Cold fusion does not exist. Every success in this field in the last 3000 years eventually proved to be a mistake or a fraud.{NEWLINE}However, there are such things as “hot fusion”, which is a highly efficient reactor design that imitates conditions deep inside a star, and considerably cooler “warm fusion”, which is the most common kind of a ship reactor."
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR: "Alien Ship Reactor"
  STR_ALIEN_SHIP_REACTOR_ARTICLE: "Most alien ships use helium-3 fusion reactors as the source of energy. Helium-3 is usually pumped out of gas giants, but can be extracted from any rocky atmosphere-free planet close to its star. Like our moon.{NEWLINE}The reactor can be easily reproduced with Earth materials, albeit significantly bigger. Since this is beyond the scope of our missions, we are transferring the plans upstairs and let them decide who will build it.{NEWLINE}Fun fact: Birds sell their millennium-old giant warships to use as helium depots."
  STR_BATARIANS_ARTICLE_2: "The 4-eyed aliens are the second to last civilization to enter the galactic stage. They are widely despised by their neighbours for their archaic society organization, primarily for caste system and slavery. Their government frequently announces and starts ambitious plans, which they can never afford. None of that improves their popularity. Which only adds grumpiness.{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, they are our closest neighbours. If their colonization program budbet wasn't embezzled several times in a row, they would have found Earth around 1500 CE. "
